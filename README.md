# test-repo
This is my first repo in GitHub. May eventually use it to organise and version random documents and literature

- Tutorial Documents
- Notes
- Research papers
- Random pieces of codes .. more like modules / helper functions / utilities 

Ok so these changes are being made in a separate branch and evenually these will be merged back into the master :)
